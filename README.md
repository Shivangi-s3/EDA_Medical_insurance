# Medical_Insurance claims-EDA

This dataset was retrieved from Kaggle's public datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/payal292/starter-health-insurance-data-d431991e-2) and describes characteristics of members of a health insurance plan. We are performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to make better sense of the data. EDA is the process of figuring out what the data can tell us and can be used to find patterns, relationships, or anomalies to inform our subsequent analysis. There are endless ways to perform EDA, and we will explore some of them using the seaborn visualization library.
